Iâ€™m a data scientist passionate about using data to drive public health. I currently work with the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program and the Injury and Violence Prevention Program, where I focus on leveraging R to advance prevention efforts.

With a PhD in biomaterials and extensive experience in data visualization and analytics, I specialize in building interactive R Shiny dashboards, automating reports, and applying data-driven insights to complex public health challenges.
