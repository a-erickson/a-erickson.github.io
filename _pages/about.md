Iâ€™m a data scientist dedicated to using data to drive public health. I work with the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program and the Injury and Violence Prevention Program, leveraging R to advance prevention efforts.

With a PhD in biomaterials and a strong background in data visualization and analytics, I specialize in building interactive R Shiny dashboards, automating reports, and transforming complex public health data into actionable insights.
